# electrokinetic_flow_two_electrolyte_drop_model
This repository provide a set of Matlab code for solving the two-electrolyte drop model.

## An Academic Project at New Jersey Institute of Technology

## Prerequistite

This project requires Matlab 2015R or later version to run the code for solving the problem.

### Code

The matlab code consists a set of reusable function files and one script. The script are used to solve for background fluid velocity with respect to different magnitudes of zeta potential and applied electric field.
 
### Run

The scripts' file name is double_side_td, you can run the script file by swithcing current editor to the script file and clicking the 'run' button, or type in the script's file name in the command window and press enter. 

### Adjusting parameters

The parameters for the problems can be adjusted within the corresponding script.
